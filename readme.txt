Replace the WordPress toolbar with configurable hot corners.

== Description ==

Want a toolbar that stays out of the way? Hover to the corner of the page to get your admin links.
This plugin was made to enable users to get access to the admin area quickly without the default wordpress
toolbar. The four corners of the page are configurable via drag and drop settings page.

Please let me know if you have any issues with the plugin or you would like to see additions.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/hot-corners` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use the Settings->Hot Corners Name screen to configure the plugin

== Screenshots ==

the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets 
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png` 
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
